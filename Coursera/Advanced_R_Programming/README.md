# Advanced R Programming

This class required that you put together two files, one that writes four factorial functions and then test the runtime for each function to compare efficiency.

The second file is one where they wanted you to utilize R's object oriented programming capabilities. They provide you with a longitudinal dataset and requested that you make three separate classes that inherited traits from the baseclass.

This was purely used as an exercise and isn't going to be something I reuse, maybe just reference to remember how this works.
