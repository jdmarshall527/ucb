# Project Plagiarism

In this second project, I trained a classifier to detect various forms of plagiarism.  I also included the helpers.py file that helps parse the data, and the unittests.

In subfolders, I included the energy consumption warmup practice, and the training model for the plagiarism under source_sklearn.
