**Financial Engineering Repository**

I created this repository to store any and all projects I work on while completing my masters in financial engineering at UC-Berkeley.

Since I do not code for employment, my first commits are just going to be the classes I've taken online and so I have separated them by:

Company/Class/File

Just to have some organizational structure.  Once I have a more cohesive repository, I might reorganize by language or type of project but this is what I have settled on for now.
